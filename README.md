# discord_role_stripper

I used this as an opportunity to play with regex in order to pull information from a large amount of data.

I was also able to use some file based functions.

This reads the file and uses regex to find the dates you achieved your Egg, Inc discord server roles.
The file consists of the search results of your name from role-submissions channel.

The original plan was to scrape the information from discord directly, however for now that's a little beyond me and the learning in this project is sufficient.

`requirements.txt` is blank as there are no external dependencies, created for practice.
